# Yet another Covid-19 data analysis

## Origin
By early March, well before the quarantine in France (where I live), I began to analyse the JHU data to anticipate the situation in european countries. Even if Italy began to have a high number of covid-19 patients, the mortality was still low (compared to today) and France was still spared, I everyone believed the situation could evolve like this...

## Project motivation
Originaly, my analysis was made with excel and Powerquery-M which are very great tools to do quick and dirty data wrangling.
Soon after this, I began the [Udacity data scientist nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025). One of the projects of this Mooc consist to create a Blog with a repo.
Which is why I converted (and improved) my powerquery script in python

## Fonctionalities
1. Review of data structure of the different sources
2. Fonctions to tidy & draw data
3. Visual analysis of the evolution of the number of cases and deaths per day and country

## Installation
With an anaconda distribution, no specific installation is required.
The packages are common ones (pandas, numpy, matplotlib and seaborn)
Jupyter notebook is also required to open the notebook

## Results
The results of this analysis will soon be available on this [Medium post](https://medium.com/p/d73b62bf4acc/edit)
